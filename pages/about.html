      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Trinh, an introverted young girl from South Vietnam who always hopes
        to work from home. This is why I chose to study Computer Programming at
        Seneca.
      </p>
      <p>What is Chindechilla?</p>
      <p>
        Because my name is pronounced as Trinh, so I chose Chin as my nickname,
        and Chinchilla is also a cute animal.
      </p>
      <h2>Why I choose these hidden gems?</h2>
      <p>
        Because I think these are special places that can introduce the
        hometown where I grew up.
      </p>
      <h2>References</h2>
      <p>I got my images and introduce for each gems from Tripavisor and Vietnamnet.</p>
